### Huh? ðŸ¤”

Parts of Laravel that throw me

#### Loops

How it works

```php
@foreach($services as $service)
```

How I thought it would work

```php
@foreach($service in $services)
```

#### Arrays

How it works

```php
array(
  'title' => 'Hello',
  'description' => 'This is a web page'
);
```

Isn't this an object?
